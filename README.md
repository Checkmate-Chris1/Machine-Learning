# Machine-Learning 🧠📈

This is a personal playground project where I explored how AI systems actually work under the hood. Starting with raw math and no libraries, I manually built linear and polynomial regression systems by tuning weights and biases to fit small datasets.

Along the way, I visualized how these values change over time and iterations, helping me better understand optimization and convergence behavior. Later, I added a small TensorFlow-based regression example for comparison.

## 🧪 What’s Inside

- **Manual Regression Systems**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Gradient-based tuning (no backprop)
  - Iteratively fits data to minimize error

- **Custom GUI**:
  - Visualizes weights and biases as they change over time
  - Graphs how well the system fits the dataset across iterations
  - Helps visualize convergence patterns

- **TensorFlow Example**:
  - Small regression demo using TensorFlow
  - Used to compare results and validate the hand-coded models

## 💡 Purpose

- Learn what weights and biases **actually do**
- Understand how models converge to fit a dataset
- Explore machine learning from a low-level math-first approach
- Compare manual vs TensorFlow implementations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (core logic)
- `tkinter` for the GUI
- `tensorflow` for comparison models
